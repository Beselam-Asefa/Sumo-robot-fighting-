## About zumo robot 
 The Pololu Zumo robot is an Arduino-controllable tracked robot platform that is less than 10 cm × 10 cm—small enough 
 to qualify for Mini Sumo. It includes two micro metal gearmotors coupled to a pair of silicone tracks, a stainless steel 
 bulldozer-style blade, six infrared reflectance sensors for line following or edge detection, accelerometer
 and magnetometer, and a buzzer for simple sounds and music.
